# Agents

This repository keeps the agent instructions, Pi extensions, themes, and native tools I use every day. The files stay in Git; `cargo xtask harness setup` links only the managed pieces into the real Claude, Codex, and Pi directories.

The useful part is under `harnesses/pi/agent/packages`: thirteen Pi extensions, two small shared libraries, and no framework hiding how they fit together.

## Set up

You need Rust, Bun 1.3.14, [`just`](https://github.com/casey/just), and Pi.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/luan/agents.git
cd agents
just setup
```

`just setup` builds the Rust binaries, installs the JavaScript dependencies from the lockfile, creates the managed harness links, and runs the complete check suite.

The harness roots remain ordinary directories: `~/.claude`, `~/.codex`, and `~/.pi` are never replaced with symlinks. The setup tool links only the paths listed in `managed.toml`. It refuses to overwrite an unexpected file or a link owned by something else.

Pi's `settings.json` is deliberately mutable. Pi may update the repository copy through its managed link. Credentials, sessions, caches, model stores, and other generated state stay local and out of Git.

To inspect or remove the links:

```sh
cargo xtask harness check
just unlink
```

`just unlink` removes only links that point back to this checkout.

## Pi extensions

Each extension can be loaded from this checkout or installed on its own. Its README explains its settings and public API.

## Shared Pi libraries

These packages register no Pi extension by themselves.

- [`@luan.sh/pi-libactions`](harnesses/pi/agent/packages/pi-libactions/README.md)&nbsp;[<img src="https://pi.luan.sh/icons/pi.svg" width="14" alt="Pi gallery">](https://pi.dev/packages/@luan.sh/pi-libactions)&nbsp;[<img src="https://pi.luan.sh/icons/npm.svg" width="14" alt="npm">](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@luan.sh/pi-libactions) — The UI-free custom-action registry and validated `keybindings.json` loader.

`@luan.sh/pi-libtui` is the one deliberate dual-role package: imports expose reusable components without side effects, while its extension entry point installs generic terminal compatibility for Pi.

## Native tools

TypeScript registers and composes Pi features. Rust owns the process, patch, protocol, and JavaScript-runtime boundaries.

| Crate | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `apply-patch` | Parses and applies structured patches. |
| `code-mode-host` | Runs the Code Mode host process. |
| `code-mode-protocol` | Defines the host wire protocol. |
| `code-mode-runtime` | Executes restricted JavaScript and coordinates nested calls. |
| `terminal-bridge` | Runs bounded pipes and persistent PTY sessions. |
| `web-run` | Executes the native Codex web request contract. |
| `view-image` | Reads local images for Codex-compatible attachment previews. |
| `xtask` | Sets up, checks, and removes managed harness links. |

## Configure Pi

The checked-in Pi setup uses three files:

- `harnesses/pi/agent/settings.json` selects packages, models, theme, and Pi-owned behavior.
- `harnesses/pi/agent/xsettings.toml` stores settings contributed by extensions. Open it interactively with `/xsettings` or `Ctrl-,`.
- `harnesses/pi/agent/keybindings.json` owns Pi bindings and every custom extension action.

Use `Alt+P` for Pi's model picker and `Alt+,` / `Alt+.` to decrease or increase
reasoning effort. Subagents inherit the parent's model and effort unless a
spawn supplies direct overrides.

Tool visibility has three separate controls:

- `pi.defaultTools` selects direct tools.
- `pi-code-mode.tools` moves selected active tools under `exec`.
- `pi-tool-search.tools` defers selected tools within the scope where `tool_search` runs.

Code Mode alone changes tool hierarchy. Tool Search only controls deferred membership; a disabled tool is not silently made deferred.

Run `/reload` after changing package loading, keybindings, or a setting documented as reload-only. Appearance and other live settings apply immediately when their package says they do.

## Work on the repository

```sh
just check
```

On a warm checkout this builds the release binaries once, then runs the checks in phases:

- Biome formatting and Pi policy lint;
- cached TypeScript checks for every package;
- every package's test command in a separate process, run in parallel with
  package-labelled output (no shared cross-package test state);
- Rust formatting, Clippy, and the complete workspace through Nextest;
- managed harness validation.

No Rust test is ignored. `cargo nextest run --locked` runs the whole virtual Rust workspace.
Each check prints its command; `All checks passed.` appears only after every
phase succeeds. The test runner does not retry failures.

Useful narrower commands:

```sh
bun run typecheck
bun run test:pi
cargo nextest run --locked
```

See [the package migration](docs/pi-package-migration.md) for renamed packages and upgrade instructions.

## Documentation site

[pi.luan.sh](https://pi.luan.sh) renders the package READMEs and `docs/` into a static site. `site/build.ts` uses
`Bun.markdown` plus Shiki for code blocks; `site/fonts` holds the bundled IBM Plex Sans and Maple Mono NF faces (OFL 1.1).

```sh
just site        # writes site/dist
just site-dev    # serves it on http://localhost:4321 and rebuilds on change
```

Cloudflare builds it with `bun run build:site` and serves `site/dist` as static
assets per `wrangler.jsonc`. The explicit config is required because Cloudflare
refuses to auto-detect a project at the root of a Bun workspace.

## Release

Each package has its own version and release tag. Bump only the package being
released, commit, then tag that commit with its full npm name and version:

```sh
git tag @luan.sh/pi-codex-native@0.3.8
git push origin main @luan.sh/pi-codex-native@0.3.8
```

`.github/workflows/publish.yml` publishes only the named package, checks that
its version matches the tag, and skips versions already on npm. Other packages
may have the same version without being released. Tags include the scope, for example `@luan.sh/pi-code-mode@0.3.8`.
Packages with `publishAliases` also publish the same release under the listed
bare names. Existing versions are skipped independently for each name.

CI authenticates with npm trusted publishing (OIDC); each package must list
this repository's `publish.yml` as a trusted publisher on npmjs.com once.
`just pi-publish <package>` is the CI publishing recipe and requires checkout
of that package's release tag with clean package and native sources.

The pack step records the exact Git commit in every bundled native runtime.
Native builds and caches use that commit, independently of package versions.
Keep released commits reachable and never move or delete release tags.

## Common problems

**A native tool says its binary is missing.** Run `cargo build --locked --release`, or `just setup` to rebuild and check everything.

**A tool is not visible.** Check all three tool lists above. Under strict selection, `exec`, `tool_search`, and direct tools exist only when the active scope includes them.

**A fullscreen interaction is absent.** Copy mode, mouse overlays, and some selection UI require Pi's fullscreen TUI. Check `pi.tuiMode` in `xsettings.toml`.

**Setup refuses a path.** Inspect it before changing anything. The refusal means a real file or an unexpected link occupies a managed location; setup will not delete it for you.

**A package works here but not alone.** From `harnesses/pi/agent`, run `pi install packages/<name>`. Each package keeps its runtime dependencies in its own manifest, so a standalone install failure is a package bug.
