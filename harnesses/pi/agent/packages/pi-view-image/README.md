# pi-view-image

`@luan-pi/pi-view-image` adds a Codex-compatible `view_image` tool to Pi. A
native Rust binary reads and validates a local PNG, JPEG, GIF, or WebP file and
returns it as a Pi image content block, so any vision-capable model can look at
a file that is already on disk. The same package makes pasted image paths in the
Pi editor attach as images and labels image attachments in the Codex format
before they reach the provider.

Upstream attribution: see `UPSTREAM.md`.

## Install

```sh
pi install npm:@luan-pi/pi-view-image
```

Requires a Rust toolchain (https://rustup.rs). The `view_image` binary builds
itself on first use under Pi's agent directory (`native/view-image/<version>/`).
Set `PI_VIEW_IMAGE_BIN` to use a prebuilt binary; it must point to an
executable file. Pi shows an info notification while the first build runs.

Code Mode support is bundled. If `@luan-pi/pi-code-mode` is also installed
(`pi install npm:@luan-pi/pi-code-mode`), `view_image` is callable from inside
Code Mode scripts as described below; without it the tool is still available as
a normal Pi tool.

## The `view_image` tool

Parameters:

| Name | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `path` | string, required | Absolute path or a path relative to the Pi session's working directory. A leading `@` is stripped. `file_path` and `image_path` are accepted as aliases. |
| `detail` | `"high"` or `"original"`, optional | Defaults to `high`. |

Example call:

```json
{ "path": "screenshots/current.png", "detail": "original" }
```

Behaviour:

- `high` resizes images larger than 2048 pixels on either axis. Resized
  images and GIF input are re-encoded as PNG; PNG, JPEG, and WebP files that
  are not resized keep their original bytes and MIME type.
- `original` keeps the source dimensions and bytes.
- The `detail` parameter is only exposed to models that support it. For the
  `openai-codex` provider it requires the model's `compat.supportsImageDetailOriginal`
  flag; every other provider with image input gets it. When a model does not
  support it, a requested `original` silently falls back to `high`.
- Any Pi model that declares `image` in its `input` capabilities can use the
  tool. Other models get the error
  `view_image is not allowed because the current model does not support image inputs`
  before the file is read.
- The tool result contains one image content block. Its `details` record the
  input, the resolved path, MIME type, width, height, byte size, and duration in
  milliseconds.
- Errors from the binary (missing file, unsupported format, decode failure) are
  surfaced as the tool error message, truncated to 8192 characters.

### Inside Code Mode

The tool is also registered through `@luan-pi/pi-code-mode/sdk`. In a Code Mode
script, `view_image` returns `{ image_url, detail }`, where `image_url` is a
base64 `data:` URL. Forward it with `image(result)` so the model sees the image:

```js
const result = await tools.view_image({ path: "screenshots/current.png" });
image(result);
```

## Pasting image paths into the editor

In the TUI, when a paste contains a single path to an existing PNG, JPEG, GIF,
or WebP file (checked by file signature, not just extension), the path is
replaced inline with an `[Image #N]` pill. Accepted forms: absolute paths,
paths relative to the working directory, `~/` paths, `file://` URLs, quoted
paths, and shell-escaped paths. This covers Pi's clipboard image paste (Pi
writes the bitmap to a temporary file and inserts its path) and terminals that
paste a file path on Command-V. Ordinary text and non-image paths are left
alone.

When the prompt is submitted, each pending pill is loaded through the native
binary at `original` detail, attached as an image, and its text becomes a
`<file name="..."></file>` tag. If a file cannot be loaded, the pill reverts to
the plain path and Pi shows a warning `Could not attach <path>: <message>`.
Pending pills are cleared on session start and shutdown.

## Codex-style image labels

Before each request is sent to the provider, user messages whose first text
block contains `<file name="...">` tags with image extensions (`bmp`, `gif`,
`jpg`, `jpeg`, `png`, `webp`) and a matching number of image blocks are
rewritten. Each image tag becomes:

```
<image name=[Image #N] path="...">
<the image block, detail high>
</image>
```

followed by the rest of the user's text. Tags are only rewritten when the count
of image tags equals the count of image blocks; otherwise the message is left
unchanged. This applies to Pi's own `@image` attachments and to pastes handled
by this package, and is provider-neutral.

## Configuration

The package has no settings. The only configuration is the
`PI_VIEW_IMAGE_BIN` environment variable described under Install. It
registers no keybindings; pasting uses the editor's normal paste path.
